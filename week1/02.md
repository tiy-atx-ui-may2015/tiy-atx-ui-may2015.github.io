Watch [Using CodePen](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/112-using-codepen/), by Chris Coyier (video)


### Assignments
* Create a 5 separate CodePens to show in class tomorrow that experiments with the box model after reading [Box model](http://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/). Save the pen to your own accounts, and fork every time you start a new one.

1. On the first one,

	* create a 'container' div that is 960px width at maximum and 90% of the screen at any size below that. Make it center, and make sure everything else you add is added INSIDE the 'container'
	* create a div called 'left-col' and a div called 'right-col' that both have a minimum height of 200px and a width of 50%.
	* Float the 'left-col' to the left, make the background #9DBA7A.
	* Float the 'right-col' to the right, make the background #62A265.
	* Save pen, and copy the link somewhere else.

2. Start new pen, by forking the first one.

	* after forking, add another div called 'main' to the next line and make it's height the same as the other divs.
	* Make the background #2A867B
	* Below 'main', add another 'left-col' and 'right-col'
	* On the next line, add three equally spaced divs called 'thirds', with  that all float left, with a margin of 2% on both sides of the middle div. Each 'third' should be 100px tall and have a background that is #2B3074.
	* Save pen, and copy the link somewhere else.
3.  Start new pen, by forking the second one.

	* Clear the last 'third', so its on the next line, and add one more div with a 2% margin in between the third and a fourth 'third'.
	* Save pen, and copy the link somewhere else.

4. Fork the third pen, and do the following:

	* add another row of thirds, that do not float up onto the next line.
	* You should end up with 2 on the first row, two on the second, and three on the third.
	* Add another 'main' div.
	* Save pen, and copy the link somewhere else.

5. Fork the fourth pen, and do the following:
	* Change all floats to float to the right, and also any clears.
	* Save pen, and copy the link somewhere else.

6. Send Sam an email with the subject line "Day 02: Homework" with all 5 links listed and numbered.
