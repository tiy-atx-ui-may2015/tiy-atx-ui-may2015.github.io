### Communication Policy
* More is better than less
* A peer is better than a Google search
* A google search is better than staring into the abyss
* Stargazing is better than giving up
* Asking for help is always encouraged
* Sharing is good, but always include a source. Do not spread misinformation
* HipChat and Basecamp, and especially lab hours, are your friend
* Be open when you are struggling, feeling behind, or overwhelmed

### Code of Conduct
Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules apply equally to teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended—a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us, the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class, lab, HipChat, Basecamp, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts, etc.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by talking to your teacher. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your teacher, speak with any Iron Yard teacher or campus director.

**Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**

**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Iron Yard community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Iron Yard community.

**Be careful in the words that you choose.** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this class. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

**When we disagree, we try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
